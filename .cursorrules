# .cursorrules - Project Intelligence & Learning Journal

# This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project-specific intelligence.
# It helps in working more effectively by remembering:
# - Critical implementation paths
# - User preferences and workflow
# - Project-specific patterns (e.g., coding styles, architectural choices)
# - Known challenges and their solutions/workarounds
# - Evolution of project decisions
# - Tool usage patterns and configurations

# Add your project-specific rules and observations below.
# Example:
# ## Frontend Development
# - Always use functional components with hooks for React.
# - Prefer TailwindCSS for styling.

# ## Backend API
# - Follow RESTful principles for all new endpoints.
# - Ensure all database queries are optimized.

## Component Usage Patterns

### Card Component (`src/components/Card.tsx`)
- To render main content within the `Card`'s structured layout (body area, distinct from explicit header/footer sections provided by the Card itself), use the `ContentComponent` prop.
- Passing children directly to `<Card>{children}</Card>` may result in the children not being rendered within the Card's intended content area, as the component primarily uses props like `heading`, `content`, `footer`, `HeadingComponent`, `ContentComponent`, and `FooterComponent` to structure its display.
