# Product Context

This document outlines the 'why' behind the project. It details the problems the project aims to solve, how it should function from a user's perspective, and the desired user experience.

## Problem Statement

- Users need a comprehensive tool to manage study materials, especially PDFs, and create effective study aids like occlusion cards.
- Tracking study progress, maintaining streaks, and understanding material mastery can be challenging without dedicated tools.
- Coordinating study schedules and collaborating with study partners or groups can be difficult.

## Functional Overview

- The app will allow users to import and organize PDFs into notebooks and topics.
- Users can annotate PDFs with highlights and notes.
- Users can create occlusion cards from PDF content or other sources for quizzing themselves, with spaced repetition logic.
- The system will track various study statistics (e.g., mastery levels, review streaks, time spent per topic).
- Users can schedule exams and set reminders.
- Users can form or join 'cliques' (study groups/partners) to collaborate, share progress, and receive group notifications.
- The application will support offline access to study materials and data.

## User Experience Goals

- Provide a user-centric and intuitive interface for managing study materials and tracking progress.
- Ensure robust offline-first capabilities for uninterrupted studying.
- Optimize the experience for Android phones and tablets, considering different screen sizes.
- Facilitate seamless collaboration and communication within study groups.
- Offer clear visualizations of study statistics and mastery to motivate users.
